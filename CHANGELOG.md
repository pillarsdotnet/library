# Changelog

Notable changes to this project. The [README](./README.md) describes the app as
it stands now; this file is where the history lives.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Contribute missing metadata back to Open Library, through a review queue.
  Nothing is sent without approval, and only fields Open Library leaves empty
  are ever offered — covers, physical dimensions, binding, page count, and the
  series tag on the work. See "Contributing back to Open Library" in the README
  for the account setup and for why series position is not contributed.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

### Fixed

- The cover-adjust dialog opened onto a solid black rectangle: the corner
  editor's overlay set `display`, which outranks the browser's own `[hidden]`
  rule, so it covered the cropper while still marked hidden. `hidden` is now
  honoured globally, which also un-broke the library fields and the loaned-to
  and parent-genre labels.

## Earlier

Before this file existed, the git log was the changelog. `git log --oneline`
covers everything up to and including "Drag the corners yourself, now or later".
